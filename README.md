# MNIST-digits


MNIST_Digits-overview.ipynb is a jupyter notebook giving an introduction to the MNIST handwritten 
digit recognition problem, particularly represented by the kaggle playground competition.  The user 
will need the train and test csv from the input folder or obtain it separately from 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data in order to actually run the code.  Consult he notebook 
itself for, at times verbose, explanations of what is being covered.

MNIST_Digits-overview.py is the output of jupyter's "download as python" function and likely will not give
good results if run directly.  It has been included so that students can easily read the code and modify it 
to run in their favorite python environment.

Finally MNIST_Digits-overview.html is the output of jupyter's "download as html" function that would allow someone 
without jupyter to follow the presentation in the notebook.`
